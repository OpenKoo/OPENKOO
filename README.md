## Highlights and Features

OpenKoo is an all-in-one NFT creation platform which is open and accessible to everyone.The NFTs created are unique with some features to provide a better experience which are as follows:  
1.Three different types of NFTs: ERC721,ERC1155 and ERC721R, with their emphasis on minimal unit,refundable and mass production respectively.  
2.Support various NFT formts such as image, video,audio and 3D model.  
3.Provide decentralized file storage.  
4.Able to set unified rarity parameters.  
5.Able to DIY personal or unique rarity parameters.  
6.The NFT space needs greater accountability. The space faces too many rugpulls and for the health of the NFT ecosystem as a whole we need better mechanisms to prevent these from happening.Offering refunds provides greater protection for buyers and more legitimacy for creators.ERC721R provides trustless refunds.
